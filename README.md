# Tor Exit Ops
Search the available exit nodes of the Tor network for specified website and monitor their availability.

These scripts were used to find the Tor exit nodes that were not blocked by the GFW.
But I found that all the Tor exit nodes will eventually be blocked.
The number of Tor exit nodes is relatively small.

In addition, when using Tor, you will often be blocked by the websites you wanna to browse, or hit CAPTCHAs.
The experience is so bad.
So I eventually decided to use anonymous proxy pool instead.
